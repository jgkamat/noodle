In addition, [reddit.com/r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6qqnun/what_is_the_legal_definition_of_a_sandwich/) established the following definition:
1. A sandwich is a single piece of bread or two pieces of bread(of roughly equal size) that and surrounds a filling on both the top and bottom as it is eaten, where the bottom of the sandwich is gripped by thumb(s) and the top is gripped by finger(s).
2. The bread must have been baked prior to being combined with the filling(i.e., no Calzones)
3. Where the sandwich is one (rather than two) pieces of bread, the filling must be typically found in two-bread sandwiches in the same form. (I.e., no burritos)
4. Where substituted as a low-carb option, lettuce can be substituted for bread provided nothing else is changed and filling is the same as is typically found in two-bread sandwiches.
